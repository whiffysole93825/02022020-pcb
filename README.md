A larger than usual 40% keyboard PCB supporting MX and Alps type switches.

This rather simple design that's probably been done before came about from wanting a 60% keyboard that was still smaller, yet retaining the full set of symbols in their normal positions. 

Design goals:
  - Must work with a Pro Micro, but this may change to an onboard controller in the future once I have the skills to figure that one out.
  - Compact, but still have access to most of the symbols I use frequently.
  - Control must be in its proper location, where Caps Lock is usually.
  - Use an otherwise standard physical layout for compatibility with cheap keycaps.
  - MX and Alps compatible.
